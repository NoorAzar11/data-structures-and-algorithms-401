Challenge Setup & Execution
Branch Name: trees

Challenge Type: New Implementation

Features
Node
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Binary Tree
Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors. For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
Binary Search Tree
Create a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
Add
Arguments: value
Return: nothing
Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Contains
Argument: value
Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
