### Pseudocode
  InsertionSort(int[] arr)

    FOR i = 1 to arr.length

      int j <-- i - 1
      int temp <-- arr[i]

      WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
        arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
        j <-- j - 1

      arr[j + 1] <-- temp

## Approach & Efficiency

Time: O(n^2)
The basic operation of this algorithm is comparison. This will happen n * (n-1) number of times…concluding the algorithm to be n squared.
Space: O(1)
No additional space is being created. This array is being sorted in place…keeping the space at constant O(1).

### blog 
In the first pass through of the selection sort, we evaluate if there is a smaller number in the array than what is currently present in index 0. We find this smaller number right away in index 1. The minimum value gets updated to remember this index. At the end of the evaluation, the smaller number will be swapped with the current value in index i. This results in our smallest number of our array being placed first.
